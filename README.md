# A Study of the Italian IT Initiatives against Covid19: Report, Clustering and Taxonomy

In this work, we survey the initiatives of the Italian computer science communityagainst the Covid19 pandemic.  Data obtained from a survey carried out in May 2020, during the first pandemic wave in Italy, by the Covid19-IT Task Force established by CINI (National Interuniversity Consortium for Informatics) were studied and reportedthrough descriptive statistics.  The 128 responses collected in this way allowed us toobserve the spontaneous reaction of this community, made up of variousinitiatives/projects throughout Italy carried out both by independent subjects and byforms of organizations able to collaborate actively even at a distance.  Natural LanguageProcessing techniques were applied to the descriptive content of the surveyed projects.In this way, it was possible to realize semantic clusters based on embeddingrepresentations both classic and based on the most current transformer architectures.The result of this elaboration has been the input for the realization of a publiclydistributed taxonomy that aims to support the classification of future projects in thepandemic field.
